# Package Initialization

# This file contains .onLoad() hook for S7 method registration
#
# S7 Method Registration:
# - S7 uses dynamic run-time registration, not the NAMESPACE file (unlike S3/S4)
# - S4_register() must be called for each S7 class before methods_register()
# - methods_register() must be called in .onLoad() per S7 documentation
# - See: https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/articles/packages.html
#
# Note on "Overwriting method" messages during development:
# - This is a known issue with devtools::load_all() (GitHub issue #474)
# - Methods get registered twice: during sourcing and in .onLoad()
# - This does NOT affect installed packages, only development workflows
# - See: https://github.com/RConsortium/S7/issues/474

# Internal mutable package state (e.g. one-time user notifications). Parented on
# `emptyenv()` so nothing leaks in from the global environment.
.medfit_state <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())

# Emit `msg` via message() at most once per session, keyed by `id`. Used for
# advisory nudges that would otherwise spam tight refit loops (e.g. bootstrap).
.notify_once <- function(id, msg) {
  if (isTRUE(.medfit_state[[id]])) {
    return(invisible(FALSE))
  }
  .medfit_state[[id]] <- TRUE
  message(msg)
  invisible(TRUE)
}

# Show-method body for S7 classes whose `show` is registered in `.onLoad()`.
# Kept as a named top-level function (not an inline body in `.onLoad`) so the
# `print()` call is not seen as a startup message by R CMD check.
.show_via_print <- function(object) {
  print(object)
}

.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  # Register S7 classes with S4 system
  # This must happen before methods_register() to avoid

  # "Class has not been registered with S4" errors
  S7::S4_register(MediationData)

  # Register S7 methods for dispatch
  # This is required for methods on generics from other packages
  S7::methods_register()

  # `show` is an S4 generic; registering an S7 method for it requires the class
  # to be S4-registered first, so it cannot live at source time in classes.R
  # (where it would run before .onLoad). Register it here, after S4_register().
  # Bind the generic to a local symbol first: the `method(...) <-` replacement
  # form cannot take a namespaced LHS (`methods::show`). The method body lives in
  # the top-level helper `.show_via_print()` so no literal `print()` call sits in
  # `.onLoad` (which R CMD check would flag as a startup message).
  show <- methods::show
  S7::method(show, ParallelMediationData) <- .show_via_print
  S7::method(show, InteractionMediationData) <- .show_via_print

  # Explicitly register the S3 print method for `mediation_effect`.
  #
  # `mediation_effect` is a lightweight S3 class layered on top of `numeric`
  # (objects returned by nie()/nde()/te()/pm()). Because `print` is an
  # internal generic and the object's implicit class includes the base
  # `numeric` type, S3 dispatch to `print.mediation_effect` can fail to find
  # the method via the package's own method table -- `print()` then silently
  # falls back to `print.default`, showing the bare numeric value and the
  # raw class/type attributes instead of the formatted label.
  #
  # Registering the method here, into the standard S3 dispatch table,
  # guarantees `print()` reaches `print.mediation_effect` regardless of how
  # the package is loaded (installed or via load_all()).
  registerS3method("print", "mediation_effect", print.mediation_effect)

  # Same issue for the `summary.*` print methods. `summary()` on the S7 data
  # objects returns a plain S3-classed list (e.g. class "summary.MediationData"),
  # but the `S3method(print, summary.*)` NAMESPACE directives are not activated
  # once `print` participates in S7 dispatch -- `print(summary(x))` then falls
  # back to `print.default` and dumps the raw list instead of the formatted
  # summary. Registering them here restores dispatch (installed or load_all()).
  registerS3method("print", "summary.MediationData", print.summary.MediationData)
  registerS3method("print", "summary.BootstrapResult", print.summary.BootstrapResult)
  registerS3method("print", "summary.SerialMediationData", print.summary.SerialMediationData)

  # Register extraction methods for suggested packages (S4 classes)
  # lavaan is in Suggests, so we register dynamically if available

    }, error = function(e) {
      # Silently fail if registration fails (e.g., lavaan not fully loaded)
